The other day I have bought a new cook book. It is awesome. There are lots of great recipes in it and I can't wait to cook them all. 
Before you travel in a different country you need to make sure you book a hotel, else you might end up on the street.
My neighbours told us a scary story about a woman who fell in the well. 
I was not feeling well after hearing it.
You need to bow every time the queen walks in or it will cost you your head.
He always wanted to learn how to shoot an arrow, but didn't manage to buy a bow.
He was our only hope in getting out of town.
Let's hope we can save some money for a ride home.
